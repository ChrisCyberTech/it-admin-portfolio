# 📌 **Summary / Lessons Learned**

This lab demonstrated a realistic scenario where a user accidentally deletes an important file from a shared folder. Shadow Copies provide:

### ✔ Fast file recovery without needing a full backup  
### ✔ End-user self-service via Previous Versions  
### ✔ Protection against accidental deletion or overwriting  
### ✔ Low-storage, low-maintenance snapshots  
### ✔ A critical feature in enterprise file servers  

You learned how to:

- Configure Shadow Copies (volume-level snapshots)  
- Manage storage allocation and schedules  
- Restore files or folders using Previous Versions  
- Verify successful recovery  

Shadow Copies are one of the simplest, fastest, and most effective safety mechanisms for shared folders on Windows Server.
